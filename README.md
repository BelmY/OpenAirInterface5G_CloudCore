# OpenAirInterface5G - SDR and Cloud based deployment
This tutorial is intended to setup all the OpenAirInterface5G components using the S1 interface, placing the core components in a cloud based system. The connection between OAI-UE and the OAI-eNB will be carried out by using USRP B210 SDR cards connected using wires and the selected cloud system where cloud components will be deployed will be OpenStack.

## Hardware setup
The proposed deployment has been tested using the hardware showed in the following figure:

![Alt text](/hw_configuration.PNG?raw=true "Optional Title")

The attenuation between UE and eNB should be adjusted between 40 and 60 dB.

## Core components deployment (HSS, MME and SP-GW).
The core components will be deployed in a cloud based system. In this tutorial, we are going to use OpenStack as a virtual machines manager. For this deployment we need three virtual machines, one per OpenAirCN componet with the following configuration:
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (32-bits or 64-bits)
* Kernel setup: Install 4.7.x kernel from pre-compiled debian package
  * `git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/linux-4.7.x.git`
  * `cd linux-4.7.x`
  * `sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-4.7.7-oaiepc_4.7.7-oaiepc-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb linux-image-4.7.7-oaiepc_4.7.7-oaiepc-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb`
* Install git 
  * `sudo apt-get install git`
* Download the latest development branch of OpenAir-cn
  * `git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openair-cn.git`
  * `git checkout develop`
  * `git fetch && git pull`

### Core Components Network Configuration
Once we have our virtual machines running, we have to configure all the network devices in order to allow the communication between them. We propose the following network configuration (OpenStack):

### Setup communication between eNB and Cloud based Core Network
Before start configuring the core components, we have to setup a VPN between eNB, MME and SP-GW in order to allow IP level communication between them. In order to do so, we are going to setup an OpenVPN server in the eNB and generate certificates for both MME and SP-GW following this tutorial [How To Set Up an OpenVPN Server on Ubuntu 14.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-14-04).

## Kernel requirements for eNB and UE

### Low-latency kernel installation
To install the low-latency kernel 3.19 on top of Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit architecture type
* `sudo apt-get install linux-image-3.19.0-61-lowlatency linux-headers-3.19.0-61-lowlatency`

### Power management
Remove all power management features in the BIOS (sleep states, in particular C-states) and CPU frequency scaling (Intel SpeedStep). In some cases, you can also do this with cpufreqtool. Also, disable hyperthreading in BIOS and make sure its turned off in Linux
* [Disable CPU frequency scaling](https://askubuntu.com/questions/523640/how-i-can-disable-cpu-frequency-scaling-and-set-the-system-to-performance)
* Disable p-state and c-state in linux
  * `sudo vim /etc/default/grub`
  ```
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_pstate=disable"
  ```
  * `sudo update-grub`
* Append "blacklist intel_powerclamp" to the end of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, to blacklist the intel_powerclamp" module. If the file does not exist, create one, and add the line into it.
* You also need to disable hyperthreading, CPU frequency control, C-States, P-States and any other power management from BIOS as well.

## OAI eNB deployment
### Build eNB
Build the eNB supporting USRP B210
* `cd ~/openairinterface5g`
* `source oaienv` - It sets the environment variables with the needed values 
* `cd cmake_targets`
* `./build_oai -I -w USRP --eNB` - The "-I" option is needed only once, then you can build without this option

This should starts the building process in ~/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/lte_build_oai.

### eNB configuration to Access OpenStack-Based core network
Now, we have to specify how the core components could be accessed by the eNB. Remember that we are going to use a VPN to provide IP level connectivity between the eNB and the core components located at the eNB. It is important to take into account that core components must be able to reach the eNB, because it will act as VPN server as we mentioned before.

Let's modify the configuration file that will be used when running the eNB in order to allow it to reach the core components.
* Modify the eNB's configuration file
  * `vim ~/openairinterface5g/targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-LTE-EPC/CONF/enb.band7.tm1.usrpb210.conf`
```
////////// MME parameters:
mme_ip_address      = ( { ipv4       = "VPN_MME_IP";
                          ipv6       = "192:168:30::17";
                          active     = "yes";
                          preference = "ipv4";
                        }
                      );

NETWORK_INTERFACES :
{
    ENB_INTERFACE_NAME_FOR_S1_MME            = "TUN_IFACE";
    ENB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_S1_MME              = "TUN_IFACE_IP/NETMASK";

    ENB_INTERFACE_NAME_FOR_S1U               = "TUN_IFACE";
    ENB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_S1U                 = "TUN_IFACE_IP/NETMASK";
    ENB_PORT_FOR_S1U                         = 2152; # Spec 2152
};
```
This configuration file contains all the different parameters of the eNB such as number of resource blocks that will be used, band, rx/tx gain, etc. In case you want to run the eNB with other configuration, refer to this file.


## OAI UE deployment
### Build UE
Build the UE supporting USRP B210
* `cd ~/openairinterface5g`
* `source oaienv` - It sets the environment variables with the needed values 
* `cd cmake_targets`
* `./build_oai -I -w USRP --UE` - The "-I" option is needed only once, then you can build without this option

This should starts the building process in ~/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/lte_build_oai.

## Running all the components
### Running Core components
* HSS
  * `cd ~/openair-cn/SCRIPTS`
  * `./run_hss`
* MME
  * `cd ~/openair-cn/SCRIPTS`
  * `./run_mme` - once started, we should see in the HSS log a "MME status changed to active" message
* SP-GW
  * `cd ~/openair-cn/SCRIPTS`
  * `./run_spgw`

### Running eNB
* `cd ~/openairinterface5g/`
* `source oaienv`
* `cd cmake_targets`
* `sudo -E ./lte_build_oai/build/lte-softmodem -O $OPENAIR_TARGETS/PROJECTS/GENERIC-LTE-EPC/CONF/enb.band7.tm1.usrpb210.conf`

After a few seconds, we can see a "Associated MME 1" message in the eNB log and finally the eNB starts waiting for connections showing two "got sync" messages.

### Running UE
This is the more sensitive part because depending on the attenuation that we have in our wires, we have to adjust the rx/tx gain to get the UE connected to the eNB. In our deployment, we have 45 dB attenuation per wire. Before run the UE, we have to install the ue_ip.ko kernel module in order to bring up the OIP interface, oip0, that will be configured with the IP received from the SP-GW through the MME. In order to do so, we have to insert the ue_ip.ko module provided by OpenAirInterface5g.
* `cd ~/openairinterface5g/`
* `source oaienv`
* `sudo insmod $OPENAIR_TARGETS/bin/ue_ip.ko`

Now, run the UE
* `cd ~/openairinterface5g/`
* `source oaienv`
* `cd cmake_targets/lte_build_oai/build`
* `sudo -E ./lte-softmodem -U -C2660000000 -r25 --ue-scan-carrier --ue-txgain 85 --ue-rxgain 100`

After that, check that you have an IP address in one of the oip interfaces created by the ue_ip.ko module (usually oip1).

### Check ip routes
When all the componets are well connected, we need to check the routes that we have along the path to reach internet (UE physical machine, eNB physical machine and SP-GW virtual machine) in order to allow the UE to reach the internet through the already deployed architecture.
